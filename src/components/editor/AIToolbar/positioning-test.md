# AI Toolbar Positioning Fix

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated AIToolbar.tsx Configuration:
- Changed `placement: 'bottom'` to `placement: 'bottom-start'`
- Increased `zIndex` from 30 to 25 (lower than TextMenu)
- Enabled `flip` modifier with proper fallback placements
- Increased `offset` from [0, 16] to [0, 20] for better separation
- Added `updateDelay={300}` to reduce conflicts
- Updated `shouldShow` logic to require minimum 5 characters for activation

### 2. Added Custom CSS (ai-toolbar.css):
- Proper z-index hierarchy: TextMenu (50) > AI Toolbar (25)
- Fixed tippy-content styling
- Ensured proper pointer events

### 3. Updated TextMenu.tsx:
- Added explicit `tippyOptions` with `zIndex: 50`
- Set `placement: 'top'` to ensure it appears above text
- Added `offset: [0, 8]` for consistent spacing

## Expected Behavior:
- **TextMenu**: Appears ABOVE selected text (z-index: 50)
- **AI Toolbar**: Appears BELOW selected text (z-index: 25)
- **AI Toolbar**: Only shows for selections > 5 characters
- **No Overlap**: Proper vertical separation between menus

## Testing Instructions:
1. Select 1-5 characters → Only TextMenu should appear above
2. Select 6+ characters → Both menus should appear (TextMenu above, AI Toolbar below)
3. No visual overlap or positioning conflicts
